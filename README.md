# Three.js Starfield Animation

This is a simple starfield animation created using the Three.js library. It generates a starry background with stars that appear to move downwards to create a parallax effect. The stars wrap around when they move out of the canvas area.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   \`\`\`bash
   cd <project_directory>
   \`\`\`

3. Install the required dependencies:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can run the animation by opening the \`index.html\` file in a web browser.

The animation will start automatically and display a starfield that moves downwards with a parallax effect.

## Customization

You can customize the animation by modifying the JavaScript code in the \`index.js\` file. Here are some customization options:

### Number of Stars

You can adjust the number of stars by changing the value in the following line of code in \`index.js\`:

\`\`\`javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 2000; i++) {
\`\`\`

Simply change \`2000\` to your desired number.

### Star Size and Color

You can modify the size and color of the stars by changing the properties of the \`starMaterial\` object in \`index.js\`:

\`\`\`javascript
let starMaterial = new THREE.PointsMaterial({
    color: "gray",
    size: 0.5,
    map: sprite,
})
\`\`\`

Adjust the \`size\` and \`color\` properties to achieve your desired visual effect.

### Star Texture

You can replace the star texture by providing a different image URL to the \`THREE.TextureLoader().load()\` function in \`index.js\`:

\`\`\`javascript
let sprite = new THREE.TextureLoader().load("./images/circle.png")
\`\`\`

Replace \`"./images/circle.png"\` with the URL of your desired star texture.
